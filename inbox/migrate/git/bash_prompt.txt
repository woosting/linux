====== bash prompt ======
Created Monday 16 January 2017

To embed @git @branch and @git @status @indicator into @bash @prompt:

1. Install the bash-completion package: ''~# apt-get install bash-completion -y''
2. Open the bash configuration file for editing: ''~$ vim ~/.bashrc''
3. Add the following lines:

	'''
	# Bash completion
	  if [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
	    . /etc/bash_completion
	  fi
	'''

4. Modify the prompt to have the git information included:
	'''
	
	export PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[01;33m\]$(__git_ps1)\[\033[01;34m\]\$\[\033[00m\] '
	'''

	This causes the prompt to show the username and hostname (green) and the current working directory (blue). Only when you're inside a Git repository, it will show the current branch (yellow). In case you already have a fancy pants prompt, it's a matter of incorporating the ''__git_ps1'' function call.

5. Optionally activate its git status indicator, by adding the following line, //before the line that was added in the previous step//:

	'''
	export GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1
	export PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[01;33m\]$(__git_ps1)\[\033[01;34m\]\$\[\033[00m\] '
	'''


	This is optional, but when implemented it *must* precede the PS1 line!
	
6. Reload bash configuration: ''~$ source ~/.bashrc''

3. Causes an additional * (asterisk character) to show whenever there are non-committed changes around. It also shows a + (plus character) for changes which are staged but not yet commited (git add). Note that having this inplace causes repositories to take considerably longer to load, because it takes a while to check the repository for pending changes (usually only the first time it is accessed, as the disk cache should speed things up afterwards).
