====== logrotate ======
Created Sunday 22 January 2017

To define a @log @rotation:
* **root@system:~#** ''vim /etc/logrotate.d/<name-of-log>''

===== Example code =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
/var/log/<name-of-log.log> {
size 1k
create 700 root root
rotate 4
compress
}
}}}

In the above configuration code:
* **size 1k** – logrotate runs only if the file size is equal to (or greater than) this size.
* **create** – rotate the original file and create the new file with specified permission, user and group.
* **rotate** – limits the number of log file rotation. So, this would keep only the recent 4 rotated log files.
* **compress **– This will compress the file.

===== Test run =====
**root@system:~#** ''/usr/sbin/logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf''

===== All options =====
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
compress             --> Compresses all noncurrent versions of the log file
daily,weekly,monthly --> Rotating log files on the specified schedule
delaycompress        --> Compresses all versions but current and next-most-recent
endscript            --> Marks the end of a prerotate or postrotate script

notifempty           -->  Does not rotate the log file if it is empty
olddir "dir"         --> Specifies that older verions of the log file be placed in "dir"
postrotate           --> Introduce a script to be run after log has been rotated
prerotate            --> Introduce a script to be run before any changes are made
rotate 'n'           --> Include 'n' versions of the log in the rotation scheme
sharedscripts        --> Runs scripts only once for the entire log group
size='logsize'       --> Rotates if log file size > 'logsize (eg 100K, 4M)
}}}
