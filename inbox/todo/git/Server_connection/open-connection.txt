====== open-connection ======
Created Sunday 22 January 2017

To @connect (e.g. to @push / @pull) to @Github using an @rsa @key from an open connection:
* **user@system:~$** ''vim ~/.ssh/config'' and add:
{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
Host github.com
	Hostname github.com
	IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.github
	IdentitiesOnly yes
}}}


==== Method rationale ====
@ssh looks for the user's **~/.ssh/config** and uses the default (**~/.ssh/id_rsa**) if not specified otherwise. The **IdentitiesOnly yes** is required to prevent the [[https://serverfault.com/questions/450796/how-could-i-stop-ssh-offering-a-wrong-key/450807#450807|SSH default behavior]] of sending the identity file matching the default filename for each protocol. If you have a file named **~/.ssh/id_rsa** that will get tried //before// your **~/.ssh/id_rsa.github** without this option.
