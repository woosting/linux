@disk @usage @analyzers:

* **NCurses Disk Usage** - Ncdu is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface. It is designed to find space hogs on a remote server where you don't have an entire graphical setup available, but it is a useful tool even on regular desktop systems. Ncdu aims to be fast, simple and easy to use, and should be able to run in any minimal POSIX-like environment with ncurses installed.
* **gt5** - Quite similar to ncdu, but a different approach.
* **tdu** - Another small ncurses-based disk usage visualization utility.
* **TreeSize** - GTK, using a treeview.
* **Baobab** - GTK, using pie-charts, a treeview and a treemap. Comes with GNOME.
* **GdMap** - GTK, with a treemap display.
* **KDirStat** - KDE, with a treemap display.
* **QDiskUsage** - Qt, using pie-charts.
* **xdiskusage** - FLTK, with a treemap display.
* **fsv** - 3D visualization.
* **Philesight** - Web-based clone of Filelight.
