====== sed ======
Created Saturday 21 January 2017

@sed is a @text @manipulation program that is often used for text @substitution in existing files.

===== Escape text =====
Its syntax´s @escape @charachter is the: ''\'' (backslash) character. The following characters should be escaped by it when they are to be used literally, and hence to prevent them from being interpreted otherwise:

* **Search pattern**: ''$.*/[\]^'' (basic regular expression characters)
* **Replacement text**: ''&\/'' ('repeat match-pattern', 'escape character', and 'delimiter').

NOTE: When a delimiter other than sed´s default (slash) is used than //that// character should be escaped instead!

===== Single quote character (literal usage) =====
To include a //literal// ''´'' (single quote character) in either the search pattern or replacement text use the following string:
* **Both parts**: ''´\´´'' (to include a single quote)

===== Prepend lines =====
To append a line after the pattern: (''-i'' declares inplace replace, ''line1'' and ''line2'' are the lines to append or prepend):

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
sed -i '/pattern/a \
	line1 \
	line2' inputfile
}}}


To prepend the lines before:

{{{code: lang="sh" linenumbers="True"
sed -i '/pattern/i \
	line1 \
	line2' inputfile
}}}
