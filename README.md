# linux-notes

A collection of GNU/Linux (Debian) related notes; stored mostly for personal reference purposes.


## Command line (CLI)

* [Vim][3] to edit contents.
* [Grep][4] (search) the collection contents on keywords:
	```
	$ grep -ri "<pattern>" contents/
	```
	> `-r` recursive
	> `-i` ignore-case)

	> ALTERNATIVE: Use the provided `ngrep.sh <pattern>` (NotesGREP) to [grep][4] (search) the collection contents for info _specifically marked to be of use on CLI_ .


## Desktops

* [Atom][2] to edit, preview, browse the Markdown (.md) files.
* [Sumatra PDF reader][5] to view the occasional embedded .pdf file on Microsoft Windows.


## Online

* [GitHub][1] to view AND contribute (!).

However, the contents should perfectly be readeable in any text-only editor, as markdown syntax is used.
