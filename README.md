# linux-notes
A collection of GNU/Linux (DebianÂ®) related notes; stored mostly for personal reference purposes.

Recommended tooling:

* [Atom][1] to edit and (pre)view on desktop
* [Vim][2] to edi on cli
* [Sumatra - PDF reader][3] to view the occasional embedded .pdf file

However, the contents should perfectly be readeable in any text-only editor, as markdown syntax is used.
