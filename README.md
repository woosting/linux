# linux-notes
A collection of GNU/Linux (Debian) related notes; stored mostly for personal reference purposes.

Recommended tooling:

* [GitHub][1] to contribute (!) **online**
* [Atom][2] to edit, preview, browse on **desktop**
* [Vim][3] to edit on **cli**
* [grep -r][4] to search the collection contents for specific information **cli**
* [Sumatra PDF reader][5] to view the occasional embedded .pdf file

However, the contents should perfectly be readeable in any text-only editor, as markdown syntax is used.
