# Syncthing manual installation

1. Grab the [latest (stable) release][1] of Syncthing for your operating system and unpack it. There will be a binary called `syncthing` (or `syncthing.exe` on Windows).

2. Start this in whatever way you are most comfortable with; double-clicking should work in any graphical environment, but Iâ€™ll use the terminal to better illustrate what happens. At first start Syncthing will generate a configuration file, some keys and then start the admin GUI in your browser. Something like the following will be printed in the terminal:

```
$ syncthing

[ANSMX] 15:57:13 INFO: Completed initial scan (rw) of folder default
```

At this point Syncthing will also have set up a folder called `default` for you, in a directory called `Sync` in your home directory. You can use this as a starting point, then remove it or add more folders later.

The admin GUI starts automatically (if run from a GUI) and remains available on https://localhost:8384/. Cookies are essential to the correct functioning of the GUI; please ensure your browser accepts them.
