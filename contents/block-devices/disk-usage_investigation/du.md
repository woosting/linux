# du - Disk Usage

>	[Du][1] (abbreviated from 'disk usage') is a standard Unix program used to estimate file space usageâ€”space used under a particular directory or files on a file system.

## Simple usage

Print disk usage for the current directory (pwd):

```
$ du -hs
```

>	With:
>	`-h` making the results to be Human readable.
>	`-s` making the results to be Summarized.


## Advanced usage

Print a sorted disk usage overview of all individual items (folders and files)  in a specific directory:

```
$ du -hs </path/>* | sort -h
```

> With:
> `-h` making the results to be Human-readable.
> `-s` making the results to be Summarized.
> `/path/` declaring the directory to look in.
> `*` declaring to take all items int account.
> `|` piping (pushing) the results to another program.
> `sort` ordering the input alphabetically.
