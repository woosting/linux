# Disk usage investigators

Applications to find disk space hoggers:

- **Ncdu** - 'NCurses Disk Usage' is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface. It is designed to find space hogs on a remote server where you don't have an entire graphical setup available, but it is a useful tool even on regular desktop systems. Ncdu aims to be fast, simple and easy to use, and should be able to run in any minimal POSIX-like environment with ncurses installed.
- **gt5** - Quite similar to ncdu, but a different approach.
- **tdu** - Another small ncurses-based disk usage visualization utility.
- **TreeSize** - GTK, using a treeview.
- **Baobab** - GTK, using pie-charts, a treeview and a treemap. Comes with GNOME.
- **GdMap** - GTK, with a treemap display.
- **KDirStat** - KDE, with a treemap display.
- **QDiskUsage** - Qt, using pie-charts.
- **xdiskusage** - FLTK, with a treemap display.
- **fsv** - 3D visualization.
- **Philesight** - Web-based clone of Filelight.

Note that:
- Many haven't received updates for a while.
- Albeit more powerfull than 'du' they are also significantly bigger.
- Most (if not all) will have to be installed manually.
- 'find' can be used to explicitly find large files from the cli.
